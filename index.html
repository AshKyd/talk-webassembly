                    To start things right off, WebAssembly is <em>not</em> a
                    programming language.

                    While Javascript is a programming language, WebAssembly is
                    a binary format containing compiled bytecode. This means
                    distributing a wasm app you're distributing a precompiled
                    binary file that gets interpreted on the target computer.
                    You as the programmer don't write this code directly.

                    This binary file runs in a specific interpreter called the
                    wasm stack machine, and is comparable to other languages
                    such as with the Java Virtual Machine, or Microsoft's
                    Common Language Runtime which all their .NET languages
                    compile down to.

                    So it's a lower level compile target that a number of
                    existing languages can be compiled to.

To understand what's going on here, I want to show some side-by-side examples
to illustrate what's going on. Don't worry about understanding what's going
on here, the important part is the comparison.

On the left we have some fairly simple C++ code as our input. Once compiled this
is converted to the bitcode in the binary column, to be parsed by the wasm VM.

However the third column is a low-level textual representation which you'll
see when you view source in a browser.

                    So why do we need this? What does it give us that regular
                    Javascript doesn't?

                    For starters it's fast. It's speed-efficient
                    because it doesn't have to parse any JS at boot time, and
                    it is a lot lower level than JS so the goal is to run at
                    native speed.

                    Also, it's crazy efficient for two reasons. Firstly the
                    compiled binary size is much smaller than traditional
                    Javascript code. While Javascript can be compressed with
                    gzip, you're still going to have to decompress and parse
                    that giant glob of text. It's also efficient because the
                    output is much closer to the metal; with Javascript you need
                    to parse, compile, and optimize the code straight off the
                    bat. With a large codebase this can take a fair amount of
                    time. Further, there's more reoptimization steps as the code
                    runs, as well as garbage collection which can result in poor
                    performance.

                    With WebAssembly, you can skip all of these steps, as
                    it only needs a small compile task to convert the wasm
                    bytecode into something the CPU understands. All the
                    compilation &amp; optimization has been done ahead of time.

                    So what are the implications? For me, the two big
                    applications are games and mobile, where
                    games are performance intensive and mobile is light on
                    resources.

                    In the gaming case we're doing a lot of computation in real-
                    time, so we need our code to consistently run lightning fast
                    without pauses for garbage collection.

                    On the opposite end of the spectrum we have mobile, where
                    we're CPU constrained so our code needs to be super
                    efficient to run smoothly. Again, wasm gives us this by
                    being physically smaller, and has fewer compile steps to
                    get it to the CPU.

                    So these are the two big examples I can think of off the top
                    of my head, but there's limitless use cases and eventually I
                    can see this being used in all kinds of libraries and web
                    apps where extra performance is required.

                      So before we go any further I want to give you a brief
                      history lesson.

                      If you've been following the Mozilla Hacks blog you've
                      probably seen this graph already. It's showing the history
                      of Javascript performance.

                      In the beginning, Javascript was a toy. It was interpreted
                      at runtime and was really slow.

                      Then in 2008 along came
                      the Javascript wars and just in time compilation improved
                      performance significantly. The gist of JIT is that the
                      Javascript code could be compiled down to machine code at
                      runtime, rather than interpreted each run. This brought
                      significant performance improvements which made Javascript
                      much more suitable for proper web apps.

                      Performance has improved slowly ever since, but with
                      WebAssembly we're about to have the same kind of performance
                      boom as we had with the introduction of JIT. This is
                      understandably very exciting.

                      Since JIT made Javascript super fast, we've ended up with
                      some cool technologies come out to exploit that speed.

                      In about 2013 a new
                      tool called emscripten hit the scene which allowed devs to
                      compile C &amp; C++ for the web.

                      This was a time of crazy experiments with everything from
                      the python interpteter to the Linux kernel being ported to
                      the browser. You name it, it was ported. It really opened
                      up the web as the one true platform on which everything
                      could be run.

                      The biggest thing this enabled in my opinion was gaming.
                      Both the Unity and Unreal game engines implemented features
                      to export to the web via emscripten, making it possible to
                      develop high quality games for the web.

                      All manner of programming languages were ported too, so
                      you can run lua, pryhon, ruby or perl scripts inside the
                      Javascript engine for instance.

                      DOS game archive. They used emscripten compiled versions of
                      MAME and DOSBox, emulators that allow you to run software
                      for thirty year old architectures in the browser.

                      In doing so they were able to preserve some classic games
                      and bring them to new generations. My favourite is probably
                      Simcity (a classic!) You should definitely check them out.

                    This brings me to the next point, which is that despite all
                    the recent advances, Javascript is still pretty slow.
                    Especially when running emulators and other high-cpu tasks.

                    To counter this, the emscripten project introduced the idea
                    of asm.js. This is a subset of Javascript with a bunch of
                    compiler hints included as comments in the code.

                    What this means is that your browser would download the
                    asm.js code, run a compile step over it, then execute the
                    optimized code at much faster speeds than with regular JS.

                    While this is an incredibly cool piece of tech, on larger
                    projects you'd often wait for days for that compile step to
                    run and we're ultimately still limited to things Javascript
                    can handle so we can't make as many optimizations as we'd
                    like.

                    So this is where WebAssembly comes in, to cut out that
                    asm.js middleman. Instead of coming up with a brand
                    new piece of browser tech, wasm is actually an
                    iteration on the work done with asm.js and everything we've
                    learned from that experience.

                    Further, today's emscripten tools can output to webassembly
                    which means we've got a faster 1:1 map to webassembly with
                    the same toolchain as people have been using for the past
                    however many years.

                    Also, and this is the cool thing, wasm implements all the
                    same featuers as asm.js to the point that asm.js can be used
                    as the polyfill for wasm in browsers that don't implement
                    it yet. This means we can start using webassembly today
                    without having to worry about backward compatibility.

                    So finally what this means is that all this cool stuff from
                    emscriptenn is coming to wasm, with all the performance
                    benefits that entails.

                    We can finally run quake at native speeds in the browser!

                    <aside class="notes">
                      So let's dive into how it works from a high level and go
                      into some examples.

                      First up you've written some code, that you want to run in
                      the browser in a language like C, C++, or Rust. You need
                      to compile this code using a tool like emscripten, which
                      outputs a binary wasm file, looking much the same as the
                      binary format we saw earlier.

                      The next step is to load up and bootstrap your module
                      using Javascript. Webassembly isn't a first class language
                      like Javascript (yet), so we still need to interface with
                      JS to give it inputs and display the outputs.

                      But once you've done this, you're ready to go! This is what
                      dreams are made of!

                    <aside class="notes">
                      To do the actual compiling, there's a few different ways
                      to go about it. C and C++ can both be compiled directly
                      with emscripten's emcc command. I had to compile this
                      manually because there's no Linux binaries available and
                      it took a couple of hours, but on other platforms you
                      should be able to install it straight from the emscripten
                      sdk.

                      Second up, for those of you who don't know Rust, it's a
                      language aiming to be a safer, more concurrent version of
                      C++ and it's what Mozilla are using to slowly replace
                      Gecko with a rewrite of itself. If you're going to be
                      writing webassembly stuff from scratch, this is probably
                      the language I'd suggest you use because it's built by
                      Mozilla and it catches a lot more issues before you run
                      the code. Think of it as the TypeScript of C++.

                      I've included Rust here because I wanted to teach myself
                      as part of this exercise, but I didn't get very far with
                      it, so it's here more as an FYI. The rust compiler has
                      emscripten support built in, so you use the rust command
                      to kick off the compile.
